**2.** Add the resource to your server start config: `ensure cd_drawtextui`. The name of the folder must be `cd_drawtextui` or the resource will not function correctly.

## Is the resource not working as expected?
- Make sure the name of the folder is `cd_drawtextui`.
- Check the server console and the in game F8 console for errors.
